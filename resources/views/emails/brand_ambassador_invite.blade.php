We don't add the fragrances ourselves or outsource it to a third-party to preserve the authenticity of the brand and its fragrances.
<br> 

@component('mail::panel')
We are officially launching on 7/Dec/2020. That should give you ample time to set up.
<br> 

If you have any queries, you can mail us at <a href="mailto:customer-support@duftunddu.com">customer-support@duftunddu.com</a>.
